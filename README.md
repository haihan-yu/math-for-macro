# Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repository contains material for a one-week graduate course on mathematical methods for macroeconomics.

## Instructor

The course material was developed by [Pascal Michaillat](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/) for EC400 at the [London School of Economics & Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk).
## Course Webpage

The course is hosted at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t3.html.

## Course overview

The course covers basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. Dynamical systems are systems that involve more than one time-period; they are prevalent in many areas of macroeconomics. The course covers three methods:

1. Dynamic programming - to solve discrete-time optimization problems
2. Optimal control - to solve continuous-time optimization problems
3. Differential equations - to characterize continuous-time systems

## Course material

The repository contains all the material for the course.

+ `lectures` folder - 3 sets of lecture notes
+ `homework` folder - 13 exercises and their solutions
+ `exam` folder - a one-hour exam and its solutions

The material is available both as LaTeX files and as PDF files. The PDF files are produced by compiling the LaTeX files using pdfTeX and the MacTeX-2021 distribution.
