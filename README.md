# Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repository contains teaching material for a week-long graduate course on mathematical methods for macroeconomics. 

## Instructor

The material was developed by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) for EC400 at the [London School of Economics & Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk).

## Course webpage

The course is hosted at https://pascalmichaillat.org/c3/.

## Course overview

The course covers basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. The course covers three methods:

1. Dynamic programming – To solve discrete-time optimization problems
2. Optimal control – To solve continuous-time optimization problems
3. Differential equations – To characterize continuous-time systems

## Course material

The repository contains the LaTeX source files for all the course material. The repository also contains the PDF files produced by compiling the LaTeX files with pdfTeX and the MacTeX-2021 distribution.

The files are organized in two folders:

+ `lecturenotes` folder – 3 sets of lecture notes
+ `problemsets` folder – 4 problem sets


### LaTeX style files

The folders contain the following LaTeX style files:

+ `paper.sty` – [Commands to format academic papers](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper) 
+ `notes.sty` – Slight modification of `paper.sty` for lecture notes
+ `math.sty` – [Commands to typeset math](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math)

### Lecture notes

The `lecturenotes` folder contains the LaTeX source files for the lecture notes:

+ `notes1.tex` – Lecture notes on dynamic programming
+ `notes1.pdf` – PDF file produced by  `notes1.tex`
+ `notes2.tex` – Lecture notes on optimal control
+ `notes2.pdf` – PDF file produced by  `notes2.tex`
+ `notes3.tex` – Lecture notes on differential equations
+ `notes3.pdf` – PDF file produced by  `notes3.tex`
+ `phasediagrams.key` – Phase diagrams included in `notes3.tex`
+ `phasediagrams.pdf` – PDF file produced by `phasediagrams.pdf`

### Problem sets

The `problemsets` folder contains the LaTeX source files for the problem sets:

+ `ps1.tex` – Problem set on dynamic programming
+ `ps1.pdf` – PDF file produced by `ps1.tex`
+ `ps2.tex` – Problem set on optimal control
+ `ps2.pdf` – PDF file produced by `ps2.tex`
+ `ps3.tex` – Problem set on differential equations
+ `ps3.pdf` – PDF file produced by `ps3.tex`
+ `ps4.tex` – Cumulative problem set covering all three topics (this problem set can also be used as a one-hour cumulative exam)
+ `ps4.pdf` – PDF file produced by `ps4.tex`

Solutions to the problems sets are available to instructors [upon request](https://github.com/pmichaillat/math-for-macro/discussions).
