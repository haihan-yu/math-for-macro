# Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repository contains material for a one-week graduate course on mathematical methods for macroeconomics.

## Course Webpage

The course is hosted at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t3.html.

## Overview

These lectures cover basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. Dynamical systems are systems that involve more than one time-period; they are prevalent in many areas of macroeconomics. The course covers three methods:

1. Dynamic programming: to solve discrete-time optimization problems
2. Optimal control: to solve continuous-time optimization problems
3. Differential equations: to characterize continuous-time systems

## Material

All the material for the course is contained in the `pdf` and `tex` folders.

The `pdf` folder contains all the material for the course in PDF format.

+ `dynamicprogramming.pdf`: lecture notes covering dynamic programming
+ `optimalcontrol.pdf`: lecture notes covering optimal control
+ `differentialequations.pdf`: lecture notes covering differential equations
+ `exercises.pdf`: 13 exercises covering all three topics
+ `exercises_solutions.pdf`: solutions to the exercises
+ `exam.pdf`: one-hour exam covering all three topics
+ `exam_solutions.pdf`: solutions to the exam

The `tex` folder contains the TEX files used to create the PDF files in the `pdf` folder.

+ `dynamicprogramming.tex`: source for `dynamicprogramming.pdf`
+ `optimalcontrol.tex`: source for `optimalcontrol.pdf`
+ `differentialequations.tex`: source for `differentialequations.pdf`
+ `exercises.tex`: source for `exercises.pdf`
+ `exercises_solutions.tex`: source for `exercises_solutions.pdf`
+ `exam.tex`: source for `exam.pdf`
+ `exam_solutions.tex`: source for `exam_solutions.pdf`
+ `paper.sty`, `math.sty`, `notes.sty`: style files used in the TEX files
+ `phasediagrams.key`, `phasediagrams.pdf`: figures imported into the TEX files
