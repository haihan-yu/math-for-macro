# Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repository contains material for a one-week graduate course on mathematical methods for macroeconomics.

## Course Webpage

The course is hosted at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t3.html.

## Overview

These lectures cover basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. Dynamical systems are systems that involve more than one time-period; they are prevalent in many areas of macroeconomics. The course covers three methods:

1. Dynamic programming - to solve discrete-time optimization problems
2. Optimal control - to solve continuous-time optimization problems
3. Differential equations - to characterize continuous-time systems

## Folder Organization

The material is organized in 3 folders:

* `lectures` folder - 3 sets of lecture notes
* `homework` folder - 13 exercises and their solutions
* `exam` folder - a one-hour exam and its solutions

## Lectures

The `lectures` folder contains the following material:

* `dynamicprogramming.pdf` - lecture notes covering dynamic programming
* `dynamicprogramming.tex` - LaTeX file producing  `dynamicprogramming.pdf`
* `optimalcontrol.pdf` - lecture notes covering optimal control
* `optimalcontrol.tex` - LaTeX file producing  `optimalcontrol.pdf`
* `differentialequations.pdf` - lecture notes covering differential equations
* `differentialequations.tex` - LaTeX file producing  `differentialequations.pdf`
* `phasediagrams.key` - Keynote file containing phase diagrams included in the lecture notes
* `phasediagrams.pdf` - PDF version of `phasediagrams.key`
* `paper.sty` - LaTeX style file for scientific papers
* `notes.sty` - LaTeX style file for lecture notes
* `math.sty` - LaTeX style file containing mathematical formatting and shortcuts

## Homework

The `homework` folder contains the following material:

* `exercises.pdf` - 13 exercises covering all three topics
* `exercises.tex` - LaTeX file producing  `exercises.pdf`
* `exercises_solutions.pdf` - solutions to the exercises
* `exercises_solutions.tex` - LaTeX file producing `exercises_solutions.pdf`
* `paper.sty` - LaTeX style file for scientific papers
* `notes.sty` - LaTeX style file for lecture notes
* `math.sty` - LaTeX style file containing mathematical formatting and shortcuts

## Exam

The `exam` folder contains the following material:

* `exam.pdf` - one-hour exam covering all three topics
* `exam.tex` - LaTeX file producing  `exam.pdf`
* `exam_solutions.pdf` - solutions to the exam
* `exam_solutions.tex` - LaTeX file producing  `exam_solutions.pdf`
* `paper.sty` - LaTeX style file for scientific papers
* `notes.sty` - LaTeX style file for lecture notes
* `math.sty` - LaTeX style file containing mathematical formatting and shortcuts

## Software

The material was produced on a Mac (macOS Monterey 12.2.1) with the MacTeX-2021 distribution. The LaTeX files should be compiled with pdfTeX. The graphics were produced with Keynote (version 11.2).

## Useful resources
