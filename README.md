# Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repository contains teaching material for a week-long graduate course on mathematical methods for macroeconomics. 

## Instructor

The material was developed by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) for EC400 at the [London School of Economics & Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk).

## Course webpage

The course is hosted at https://pascalmichaillat.org/c3/.

## Course overview

The course covers basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. The course covers three methods:

1. Dynamic programming – to solve discrete-time optimization problems
2. Optimal control – to solve continuous-time optimization problems
3. Differential equations – to characterize continuous-time systems

## Course material

The repository contains all the material for the course, organized in two folders:

+ `lecturenotes` folder – 3 sets of lecture notes
+ `problemsets` folder – 4 problem sets

The material is available as both LaTeX files and PDF files. The PDF files are produced by compiling the LaTeX files using pdfTeX and the MacTeX-2021 distribution.

### LaTeX style files

The folders contain the following LaTeX style files:

+ `paper.sty` – [commands to format academic papers](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper) 
+ `notes.sty` – slight modification of `paper.sty` for lecture notes
+ `math.sty` – [commands to typeset math](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math)

### Lecture notes

The `lecturenotes` folder contains the following material:

+ `notes1.pdf` – lecture notes on dynamic programming
+ `notes1.tex` – LaTeX file producing  `notes1.pdf`
+ `notes2.pdf` – lecture notes on optimal control
+ `notes2.tex` – LaTeX file producing  `notes2.pdf`
+ `notes3.pdf` – lecture notes on differential equations
+ `notes3.tex` – LaTeX file producing  `notes3.pdf`
+ `phasediagrams.pdf` – phase diagrams included in `notes3.tex`
+ `phasediagrams.key` – Keynote file producing `phasediagrams.pdf`

### Problem sets

The `problemsets` folder contains the following material:

+ `ps1.pdf` – problem set on dynamic programming
+ `ps1.tex` – LaTeX file producing `ps1.pdf`
+ `ps2.pdf` – problem set on optimal control
+ `ps2.tex` – LaTeX file producing `ps2.pdf`
+ `ps3.pdf` – problem set on differential equations
+ `ps3.tex` – LaTeX file producing `ps3.pdf`
+ `ps4.pdf` – cumulative problem set covering all three topics (this problem set can also be used as a one-hour cumulative exam)
+ `ps4.tex` – LaTeX file producing `ps4.pdf`

Solutions to the problems sets are available to instructors [upon request](https://github.com/pmichaillat/math-for-macro/discussions).
