# Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repository contains teaching material for a week-long graduate course on mathematical methods for macroeconomics. 

## Instructor

The material was developed by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) for EC400 at the [London School of Economics & Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk).

## Course webpage

The course is hosted at https://pascalmichaillat.org/c3/.

## Course overview

The course covers basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. Dynamical systems are systems that involve more than one time-period; they are prevalent in many areas of macroeconomics. The course covers three methods:

1. Dynamic programming – to solve discrete-time optimization problems
2. Optimal control – to solve continuous-time optimization problems
3. Differential equations – to characterize continuous-time systems

## Course material

The repository contains all the material for the course, organized in two folders:

+ `lectures` folder – 3 sets of lecture notes
+ `homework` folder – 4 problem sets and their solutions

The material is available as both LaTeX files and PDF files. The PDF files are produced by compiling the LaTeX files using pdfTeX and the MacTeX-2021 distribution.

## LaTeX style files

The folders contain the following LaTeX style files:

+ `paper.sty` – [commands to format academic papers](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper) 
+ `notes.sty` – slight modification of `paper.sty` for lecture notes
+ `math.sty` – [commands to typeset math](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math)

## Lectures

The `lectures` folder contains the following material:

+ `dynamicprogramming.pdf` – lecture notes on dynamic programming
+ `dynamicprogramming.tex` – LaTeX file producing  `dynamicprogramming.pdf`
+ `optimalcontrol.pdf` – lecture notes on optimal control
