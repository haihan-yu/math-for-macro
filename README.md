# Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics

This repository contains the material for a one-week graduate course on mathematical methods for macroeconomics.

## Overview

These lectures aim to familiarize students with mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. Dynamical systems are systems that involve more than one time-period; they are prevalent in many areas of macroeconomics. The course covers three methods:

1. Dynamic programming: to solve discrete-time dynamic optimization problems
2. Optimal control: to solve continuous-time dynamic optimization problems
3. Differential equations: to characterize dynamical systems

## Material

All the material for the course is contained in the `pdf` and `tex` folders.

The `pdf` folder contains all the material for the course in PDF format.

+ `dynamicprogramming.pdf`: lecture notes covering dynamic programming
+ `optimalcontrol.pdf`: lecture notes covering optimal control
+ `differentialequations.pdf`: lecture notes covering differential equations
+ `exercises.pdf`: 13 exercises covering all three topics
+ `exercises_solutions.pdf`: solutions to the exercises
+ `exam.pdf`: one-hour exam covering all three topics
+ `exam_solutions.pdf`: solutions to the exam

The `tex` folder contains the TEX files used to create the PDF files in the `pdf` folder.
