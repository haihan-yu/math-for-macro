# Mathematical Methods for Macroeconomics: Source Files

This repository contains the source files producing all the teaching material for a week-long graduate course on mathematical methods for macroeconomics. This teaching material was developed by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) for EC400 at the [London School of Economics & Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk).

## Course webpage

The course is hosted at https://pascalmichaillat.org/c3/.

## Course overview

The course covers basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. The course covers three methods:

1. Dynamic programming – To solve discrete-time optimization problems
2. Optimal control – To solve continuous-time optimization problems
3. Differential equations – To characterize continuous-time systems

## Source files

The source files are in LaTeX format. They are organized in 2 folders:

+ `lecturenotes` folder – 3 sets of lecture notes
+ `problemsets` folder – 4 problem sets

The folders also contain the PDF files produced by compiling the LaTeX files with pdfTeX.

### Lecture notes

The `lecturenotes` folder contains the LaTeX source files to the lecture notes:

+ `notes1.tex`, `notes1.pdf` – Lecture notes on dynamic programming
+ `notes2.tex`, `notes2.pdf` – Lecture notes on optimal control
+ `notes3.tex`, `notes3.pdf` – Lecture notes on differential equations
+ `phasediagrams.key`, `phasediagrams.pdf` – Phase diagrams included in `notes3.tex`

### Problem sets

The `problemsets` folder contains the LaTeX source files to the problem sets:

+ `ps1.tex`, `ps1.pdf` – Problem set on dynamic programming
+ `ps2.tex`, `ps2.pdf` – Problem set on optimal control
+ `ps3.tex`, `ps3.pdf` – Problem set on differential equations
+ `ps4.tex`, `ps4.pdf` – Cumulative problem set covering all three topics

Solutions to the problems sets are available to instructors [upon request](https://github.com/pmichaillat/math-for-macro/discussions).

### Style files

The folders also contain the LaTeX style files that are used to format the lecture notes and problem sets:

+ `paper.sty` – [Commands to format academic papers](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper) 
+ `notes.sty` – Slight modification of `paper.sty` for lecture notes
+ `math.sty` – [Commands to typeset math](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math)
